# LLAMA3-WITH-HUGGING-FACE



##  Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to use Meta's LLaMA 3 (8B) model for local inference and experimentation. It leverages Hugging Face Transformers and integrates with Ollama to run LLMs locally‚Äîensuring privacy, speed, and cost-efficiency.

## Key Features-

- Supports running Meta's LLaMA 3 (8B) locally
- Utilizes Hugging Face‚Äôs transformers for easy model loading
- Integrated with Ollama for lightweight, private, and low-latency LLM execution
- No GPU dependency ‚Äì works on CPU (depending on Ollama setup)
- Ideal for fine-tuning, inference, and experimentation


## How It Works-

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Model Loading

 Load the LLaMA 3 model using:
- Hugging Face transformers library
- Alternatively, use Ollama to pull and run the model locally
  

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Local Execution with Ollama

- Install Ollama on your system
- Run the LLaMA 3 model via command line or API
- Benefit from fast response time and local resource usage
  

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Prompt & Inference

- Send prompts to the LLaMA model
- Get intelligent, language-aware responses from the 8B parameter model



##  Tools & Technologies

- Meta LLAMA3 (8B)
- Hugging Face Transformers
- Ollama (for local model execution)
- Python
